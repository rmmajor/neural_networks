# Neural Networks Mini Projects

This repository contains a collection of mini projects that I have worked on to learn and understand the concepts of Neural Networks. The projects are implemented using Python and TensorFlow.

---
The topics covered in the projects include:

- Dense Neural Networks
- Convolutional Neural Networks
- Time Series Forecasting
- Reinforcement Learning (Q-Learning and Deep Q-Learning)
